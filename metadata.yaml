description: "Life in the Iron Mills is a short story (or novella) written by Rebecca\
  \ Harding Davis in 1861, set in the factory world of the nineteenth century. It\
  \ is one of the earliest American realist works, and is an important text for those\
  \ who study labor and women's issues. It was immediately recognized as an innovative\
  \ work, and introduced American readers to \"the bleak lives of industrial workers\
  \ in the mills and factories of the nation.\"\nLife in the Iron Mills was initially\
  \ published in The Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 0007, Issue 42 in April 1861. After being\
  \ published anonymously, both Emily Dickinson and Nathaniel Hawthorne praised the\
  \ work. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward was also greatly influenced by Davis's Life\
  \ in the Iron Mills and in 1868 published in The Atlantic Monthly \"The Tenth of\
  \ January,\" based on the 1860 fire at the Pemberton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\n\
  Rebecca Harding Davis was considered one of the nation's first social historians\
  \ and pioneering literary artists. She wrote to find social change for blacks, women,\
  \ immigrants, and the working class throughout the Civil War. Throughout her long\
  \ career, Davis challenged traditional subjects and older styles of writing. Her\
  \ family lived briefly in Big Springs, Alabama, before moving in 1837 to Wheeling,\
  \ Virginia (now West Virginia), on the Ohio River. Its iron mills and immigrant\
  \ populations inspired the setting of Life in the Iron Mills.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
